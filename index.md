# Sebastian Jose Teran Hidalgo

sebastian.teranhidalgo@yale.edu

I am a postdoctoral associate at the Biostatistics Department at Yale University working with [Shuangge Ma](http://medicine.yale.edu/lab/ma/). I work on high-dimensional statistics and networks in cancer genomics. 

## Background

From 2010-2016 I was a PhD student at the [Biostatistics Department](http://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at the  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I was co-advised by [Michael R. Kosorok](http://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/michael-r-kosorok-phd/) and [Michael C. Wu](https://research.fhcrc.org/wu/en/group-members/michael-wu.html). Currently I am working at Yale University as a postdoctoral associate.

## Research

My latest research consist of clustering cancer data that comes from different Omic sources. For example, we have created a clustering algorithm called assisted ncut (**ANCut**) to cluster gene expression data with the help of regulators like copy number aberrations.

We are creating an R package called [**NCutYX**](https://github.com/Seborinos/NCutYX) which is currently in a GitHub repository.
